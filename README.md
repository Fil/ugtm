# uGTM
Generative Topographic Mapping with Python.

GTM is dimensionality reduction algorithm published by Bishop et al. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1998/01/bishop-gtm-ncomp-98.pdf)

This is a python implementation (using sklearn and numpy, in uGTM.py): I am debugging this right now, so it might not be optimal yet.

See the python notebook for an illustration & comparison with LLE in sklearn.

To run an example and comparing with LLE (data is in csv format):

python3.4 run_example.py --data csvlist.dat --labels csvlist.lbls
