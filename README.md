# uGTM
Generative Topographic Mapping with Python.

GTM is dimensionality reduction algorithm published by Bishop et al. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1998/01/bishop-gtm-ncomp-98.pdf)

This is python implementation (using sklearn and numpy): I am debugging this right now, so it might not be optimal yet.
